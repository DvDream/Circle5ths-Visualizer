<p>The aim of the “Circle Visualizer” project is to provide an innovative way to visualize music, highlighting the harmonic relations in a chord progression. The studies behind harmony look into the “Circle of fifths” which represent all the notes from the chromatic scale spaced by fifth intervals: through that, it can be seen what are and how many are the chords and the alterations for each key.<br>
